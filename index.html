            <h1>Coding</h1>
            <p>When you're starting your coding journey, one of the most exciting – and at times overwhelming – things about it is just how much there is to learn.

                You'll discover different languages, frameworks, libraries, inventions and conventions.
                
                One technology often requires knowledge of another one, and everything seems to be interconnected and intertwined.
                
                With new technologies coming out often in such a fast paced and ever-changing industry, it can quickly get confusing for beginner coders.
                
                When learning how to code, instead of just focusing on learning a specific technology, it can also help to learn the foundations – the building blocks – and to peel back the layers of abstraction to get to know the underlying principles that all these technologies have in common.
                
                Understanding what coding is at a fundamental level will make solving problems easier and will give you a better understanding of how these technologies work underneath the hood.
                
                In this article we will learn what coding is so you have a solid foundation on which to build.</p>

            <h1>How Do Computers Work?</h1>
            <p>Computers, when powered off, are just costly electronic machines. They're objects consisting of a bunch of metals, plastics, and other materials.

                However, once you press the power button and they have gone through their power-up process, called booting up, they come to life.
                
                Your computer turns into this extremely powerful machine. It's this electronic device that gets to do complicated tasks at mind boggling speeds that would be difficult, if not impossible, for humans to do.
                
                Their screens are vibrant and active and there's a variety of buttons and icons ready to be clicked.</p>

            <h1>Computers and Electricity</h1>
            <p>Computers are powered and function with the help of electricity.

                Electricity has only two states – it can be either turned on or off.
                
                Electricity being turned on and flowing represents true, it has the 'on' state. On the other hand, when it's turned off and not flowing this represents false and the 'off' state.
                
                It can only ever have one state at each point in time.
                
                The two states of electricity are called Binary States, the prefix bi- meaning two.</p>
